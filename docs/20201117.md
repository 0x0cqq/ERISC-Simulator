### How to code with others: Git & Github

distributed version control system

used widely in distributed development

#### Questions in collaboration

Persistent version preservation?

Save size and time.

#### Conception 

- **git**: an open source, distributed version-control system
- **GitHub**: a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git **repositories**
- **commit** 提交: a Git object, a snapshot of your entire repository compressed into a SHA
- **branch** 分支: a lightweight movable pointer to a commit
- **clone** 克隆: a local version of a repository, including all commits and branches
- **remote** 远端: a common repository on GitHub that all team members use to exchange their changes
- **pull**: 拉取 Pull operation copies the changes from a remote repository instance to a local one. The pull operation is used for synchronization between two repository instances. This is same as the update operation in Subversion.
- **push**：推送 Push operation copies changes from a local repository instance to a remote one. This is used to store the changes permanently into the Git repository. This is same as the commit operation in Subversion.
- **HEAD**: representing your current working directory, the HEAD pointer can be moved to different branches, tags, or commits when using `git checkout`
- **fork** : a copy of a repository on GitHub owned by a different user
- **pull request** 拉取请求 : a place to compare and discuss the differences introduced on a branch with reviews, comments, integrated tests, and more
