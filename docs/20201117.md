### How to code with others: Git & Github

distributed version control system

used widely in development

#### Questions in collaboration

Persistent version preservation?

Save size and time.

#### Conception 

- **git**: an open source, distributed version-control system
- **GitHub**: a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git **repositories**
- **commit** 提交: a Git object, a snapshot of your entire repository compressed into a SHA
- **branch** 分支: a lightweight movable pointer to a commit
- **clone** 克隆: a local version of a repository, including all commits and branches
- **remote** 远端: a common repository on GitHub that all team members use to exchange their changes
- **pull**: 拉取 Pull operation copies the changes from a remote repository instance to a local one. The pull operation is used for synchronization between two repository instances. This is same as the update operation in Subversion.
- **push**：推送 Push operation copies changes from a local repository instance to a remote one. This is used to store the changes permanently into the Git repository. This is same as the commit operation in Subversion.
- **HEAD**: representing your current working directory, the HEAD pointer can be moved to different branches, tags, or commits when using `git checkout`
- **fork** : a copy of a repository on GitHub owned by a different user
- **pull request** 拉取请求 : a place to compare and discuss the differences introduced on a branch with reviews, comments, integrated tests, and more

1. https://desktop.github.com/ GUI version of git and github
2. Sign up a account of github.com https://github.com/join
   + personal email preferred
3. ssh keys 
   + 【windows】https://www.jianshu.com/p/9317a927e844
   + 【macOS】https://blog.csdn.net/ShuTongIt/article/details/78902788
4. Fork & Clone
   + https://github.com/ChenQiqian/ERISC-Simulator
   + in terminal: `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/ERISC-Simulator.git`
5. add upstream
   + `git remote add <remote-name> git@github.com:ChenQiqian/ERISC-Simulator.git`
   + `git fetch <remote-name>`

NOTICE: anything unclear, ask me or use the search engine

NOTICE: make clear where your work is, your computer or GitHub?

1. get the newest version of main project
   + `git fetch`
2. Whatever you want to do, just add a branch
   + add feature: feature-xxxx
   + fix bugs: fix-bug-xxxx
   + ...
   + `git switch --no-track -c <branch> <remote-name>/<branch>` create and switch, based on remote branch, but without any track
   + `git push origin <branch-name>` create branch on remote server
   + `git push --set-upstream origin/<branch-name>` set default upstream
   + 【`git branch -d <branch>` delete local branch】
   + 【`git push origin --delete <branch>` delete remote branch]
3. Coding
   + elegance: VSCode https://code.visualstudio.com/Download 【Git Intergrated】
   + formatter: right click, remember format after coding
   + leave enough comments, make sure the code is bug-free
   + check the program: `make` [details to be done]
4. using Git to save your work
   1. `git add [file]` or `git add .`  start tracking
   2. `git commit -m "add feature: xxx"` leave a snapshot
   3. `git push` push to GitHub
5. After finishing the work: merging your part into main project: using Pull Request
   + https://github.com/ChenQiqian/ERISC-Simulator/compare/
   + remind me in WeChat, and I will check the code and merge it into the main branch
   + delete the branch in **your** repo if you want
